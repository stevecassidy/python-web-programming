These notes are being written to support COMP2110 Web Technology at Macquarie University, Sydney.
They are made available here in the hope that they will be useful to
others.

Earlier versions of this course were Python based so these notes
have lots of material on Python and Bottle for server side web
development.  Right now, we concentrate on front-end development
with Javascript and so those notes are being added to.

## Contributors

While I have written a lot of this there have been contributions of words
and ideas over the years from my co-lecturers:
Rolf Schwitter, Diego Molla-Aliod, Zhu Sun and Kate Stefanov.
